Both states have much smaller populations than Texas.\n\nAccumulating ice between 0.25 and 0.6cm (a tenth and a quarter of an inch) was possible across eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, central Tennessee, Kentucky and over into the West Virginia and Ohio border region, said National Weather Service (NWS) lead forecaster Bob Oravec.\n\nUp to 30cm (12 inches) of snow was expected across parts of the southern Plains into Monday, said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the NWS's Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThe region had been gearing up for the winter weather for the better part of the weekend. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration on February 12 for all of the state's 254 counties.\n\nA deadly pileup due to icy roads killed six that day in Forth Worth.\n\nAbbott, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson each activated National Guard units to assist state agencies with tasks including rescuing stranded drivers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency in Texas in a statement Sunday night. The declaration is intended to add federal aid to state and local response efforts.\n\nThe extreme weather is expected to continue. The NWS said Sunday that the forecast through early Tuesday calls for 20 to 30cm (8 to 12 inches) of snow in central Oklahoma, and 10 to 20cm (4 to 8 inches) in an area extending from eastern Texas to the Ohio Valley in the Northeast."}

Experts warn that ransomware attacks are on the rise due to their ease of deployment by a range of actors, including enemy nations and criminal gangs. Experts emphasize the importance of prevention and the need for a governmental role in combatting cyber attackers.\n\nThe FBI identified DarkSide, an Eastern European criminal organization, as responsible for the attack. DarkSide appears to be the largest ransomware-attack group of all time to be unmasked, according to the FBI, with at least 80 other ransomware groups and groups of hackers associated with them identified. Ransomware attacks are growing in scope and scale in the U.S., with more than 1,600 attacks on U.S. businesses in 2016, according to the FBI. Experts warn that the rise in ransomware attacks is being fueled by the ease with which they can be deployed, by criminal gangs as well as by enemy nations.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack caused a great deal of disruption to the supply of fuel and caused high fuel prices.

And for the first time in seven years, the national gas price average reached $3 a gallon.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident highlights the huge fallout cyberattacks can have on the country's critical infrastructure and raises new questions about why the U.S. is so vulnerable to such crippling strikes.\n\nExperts say ransomware attacks, in particular, have been on the rise because of how easily they can be deployed, carried out by actors ranging from enemy nations to criminal gangs.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a problem because the cyber vulnerabilities can be exploited by very small groups with small amounts of funding, it is the ultimate asymmetric threat,\" Tom Bossert, homeland security adviser under President Donald Trump told ABC News.\n\nThe FBI said Monday that ransomware from DarkSide, a criminal organization that operates in Eastern Europe, was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline network attack.\n\nWhile federal officials were still trying to determine whether a foreign nation could be involved, Russian intelligence has been known to cooperate with Eastern European cybercriminals in the past.\n\nPrevention, Bossert said, involves remembering human beings are behind the attacks.\n\n\"We need better technical solutions on that as a group or part of a group of people trying to develop innovative solutions for better technology to prevent attacks, but there's got to be a government role in stopping the human beings that are doing the attacking,\" Bossert explained.\n\nFormer Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Elizabeth Neumann, an ABC News contributor, said companies and governments need to keep pace with the growing security threat.\n\n\"There's a lot more we can be doing with our critical infrastructure,\" Neumann said. \"More of these systems are being digitized. Things that used to be manually operated are now being operated by computers and that of course creates vulnerability. The infrastructure in of itself is very expensive. A lot of it is decades old ... because they are so underfunded, they tend to not update their IT very often.\"\n\nNeumann said the impact of future cyberattacks could be much more severe, particularly if a foreign adversary is involved.\n\nAnother expert told ABC News that such a large-scale ransomware attack was only a matter of time, given the uptick and lack of cybersecurity coordination between private companies and the government, a key point in the executive order President Joe Biden signed Wednesday evening.\n\n\"It was inevitable that we would reach a point where one of these attacks would have significant economic damage,\" Dmitri Alperovitch, the executive chairman at Silverado Policy Accelerator and a former CTO of CrowdStrike, said.\n\nHackers can successfully infiltrate a system's computer network and deploy malicious software to effectively seize control, holding hostage files or data until a ransom is paid.\n\n\"Many of these ransom operations are more about extortion than ransomware where they will steal data -- typically emails -- and threaten their release and try to embarrass companies and hopefully find -- from their perspective -- find something that these companies will really want to keep quiet, whether it's intellectual property or information on customers,\" Alperovitch said, \"and that would increase the likelihood of actually getting ransom.\"\n\nThe boom in ransomware, he said, coincides with the boom in cryptocurrency."}

We also recognize that Facebook is a private entity with its own First Amendment rights to control the content it publishes. But Facebook's decision to ban Trump nonetheless illustrates serious shortcomings in its content-related decision making — as its own Oversight Board (OB) properly declared yesterday in reviewing the decision. Facebook exercises quasi-monopoly power over a critical forum in our marketplace of ideas, and for many of the same reasons that we would be suspicious of a central government authority controlling what can and cannot be said, we have concerns with Facebook exercising such unchecked power.\n\nThe OB ruled that Facebook's initial decision to suspend former President Trump's account for 24 hours on Jan. 6, 2021, after the attack on the Capitol, was proper, but that its subsequent decision to suspend his account indefinitely — a sanction that is not mentioned in Facebook's policies — was inappropriate. The board put the decision about a permanent ban back in Facebook's hands, to be made in the next six months according to the rules the company applies to other users.\n\nAs pernicious as Trump's speech was, the decisions by Facebook and other social media companies to remove Trump from their platforms highlight the immense power these corporations wield over our collective ability to speak online. For the foreseeable future, Facebook, Twitter, and a handful of other corporations will make some of the most consequential decisions affecting free expression. They present themselves as platforms for free speech rather than edited or curated newspapers. But historically they have failed to apply their own rules consistently, equitably, and transparently, or to adhere to basic notions of fair process in how they exercise the awesome power to decide what gets published on, and who can access, their forums.\n\nPerfectly consistent content moderation is impossible in light of the scale at which these platforms operate. But Facebook's failure to abide by basic principles of fairness and transparency are unacceptable given the influence they exert over our national debate. Facebook and similar platforms should err on the side of free expression, not censorship, while also offering users direct control over the content they see. Facebook effectively determines the boundaries of political speech for billions of users, even as it remains beholden to its bottom line, not the public interest.\n\nIn an attempt to add some accountability and transparency, Facebook created an Oversight Board to help it review hard questions regarding content moderation. But the company still holds too much unaccountable power over the process. The OB rightly highlighted many concerns with Facebook policies and practices that we share, but the decision also leaves crucial questions unanswered. Below we break down our take on this issue and the board's decision.\n\nWhat does the ACLU think of the Oversight Board's decision?"}
